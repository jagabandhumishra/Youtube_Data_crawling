1) create a conda environment (if don't have conda install https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation)

example: conda create -n mlsv_youtube python=3.8


2) Go to the downloaded folder through terminal and run: pip install -r requirements.txt
  
4) conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg

5) Once installed open the 'run_script.sh' file, present in 'Crawl_youtube' and edit the path and threshold value, after carefullyreading the instruction and run the same script:
bash run_script.sh
